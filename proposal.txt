Hello all:

Please feel free to choose any template or organization for the project proposal (see below for an example outline). This should not be too long (usually 2-3 pages should be enough). 

The proposal should be submitted as a single document (pdf or word) on Canvas - an assignment has been created there. You should submit a single document per team; please clearly specify the names and IDs of all the team members on the first page. 


An example proposal outline (1-2 paragraphs for each of the following points):

1) Briefly explain what problem you are trying to solve.
a) Segment
- Segment images of cells from the Caicedo Cell Painting dataset
- Analyze different segmentation techniques
- Images have 5 channels
- Image channels may not be as smooth as larger objects like cats

b) Feature extraction
- Compute features for each cell such as its size, shape, texture, etc.

c) Unsupervised learning
- See if the same treatments cluster together

2) Why is this problem important? Why are you interested in it?
- Cure cancer!

3) What is the current state-of-the-art? 
a) Segementation
- Normal images: color-based k-means, active clustering, thresholding, Otsu's method (Image segmentation wiki)

4) Are you planning on re-implementing an existing solution, or propose a new approach?** 
a) Segementation
- re-implement one
- how to combine 5 channels?
- how to combine multiple fields of view?

5) If you are proposing your own approach, why do you think existing approaches cannot adequately solve this problem? Why do you think you solution will work better? 
6) How will you evaluate the performance of your solution? What results and comparisons are you eventually planning to show? Include a time-line that you would like to follow. 

c) Learning
- Do unsupervised learning to see if the treatments cluster together?
- Can we do a supervised learning approach to predict if the cells are treated or not

Timeline

April 22 Done

** Doing something novel and creative would get a higher grade. Since doing something novel is also risky, you may first want to implement an existing approach that you know works. That way, you will also have a baseline to compare your own approach against. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
